            Agriculture is the main occupation in India. It is the largest producer (25% of global production), consumer (27% of world consumption) and importer (14%) of pulses in the world. While achieving food sufficiency in production, India still accounts for a quarter of the worldâ€™s hungry people and home to over 190 million undernourished people. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) 's 2023 global food security report, an estimated 74 per cent of the Indian population cannot afford a healthy diet. 15% of the people are below the poverty line which means that they can only afford to spend less than 50 cents a day.
